# Repo Management

Declarative, YAML-driven management of GitHub repository configuration. Describe how a
repo *should* be configured in a YAML file; `repo-management` reads the live state, shows
you the diff, and reconciles it through the GitHub API (via [PyGithub]).

It is **declarative and idempotent**: re-running when nothing has changed does nothing.
A section you don't mention is left unmanaged; a section you *do* declare is authoritative —
it's the complete desired set, so anything on the repo not listed in it is removed.

Full documentation lives at **[nivintw.github.io/repo-management][docs]**; the source code,
issue tracker, and annotated example configs live in the
[nivintw/repo-management repository][repo] on GitHub.

## Install

```bash
uv tool install repo-management    # or: pip install repo-management
```

Requires Python 3.14+. Authentication uses a GitHub token, read from `$GITHUB_TOKEN` (or
`--token`). The token needs the scopes for whatever you manage (repo administration,
Actions secrets, etc.).

## Usage

Write a config file first — the `repos.yaml` below; see [Config format](#config-format)
for the schema and the repository's annotated [`examples/`][example-base] for a working
pair. Then:

```bash
export GITHUB_TOKEN=ghp_...

repo-management validate  -c repos.yaml   # check the YAML (no network)
repo-management plan      -c repos.yaml   # show the diff (read-only)
repo-management apply     -c repos.yaml   # reconcile (prompts before writing)
repo-management list-repos                # the managed fleet across a config dir (no network)
```

Useful flags:

- `--repo owner/name` — limit the run to a single repo from the config.
- `--yes` / `-y` — skip the confirmation prompt on `apply`.
- `--token` — pass a token explicitly instead of using `$GITHUB_TOKEN`.

`plan` prints one line per change: `+` create, `~` update, `-` delete. Secret values are
always redacted.

`list-repos` prints the managed fleet — the union of the `repos:` lists across every
applied `*.yml` file in a config directory (`--config-dir`, default `config/`; `*.yaml`
files are treated as base layers, not applied configs, and are skipped). `--format names`
emits a single comma-separated line of owner-relative names, which the
[repo-management repository][repo] uses to scope its central Renovate runner's App token
(see [Fleet automation](https://nivintw.github.io/repo-management/#fleet-automation)).

## Config format

A config file lists the repositories to manage and one shared block of config sections
applied to every one of them:

```yaml
repos:
  - owner/repo
  - owner/other
settings: { ... }
rulesets: [ ... ]
labels: [ ... ]
```

### Composing configs with `extends`

A file may `extends:` one or more base files (a string or a list, relative paths, resolved
recursively). The bases are merged underneath, then this file is merged on top:

- **scalars** — the override wins;
- **list sections** (`rulesets`, `labels.items`, `collaborators`, `webhooks`, `secrets`) —
  merge by each item's natural key (ruleset/label/secret `name`, collaborator `username`,
  webhook `url`): a same-key item in the override **replaces** the base's item, and new
  items are appended.

```yaml
# repos.yaml
extends: base.yaml
repos: [owner/repo]
settings:
  description: Managed by repo-management   # added on top of base.settings
```

See [`examples/base.yaml`][example-base] + [`examples/repos.yaml`][example-repos] in the
repository for a fully-annotated, working pair.

> `extends:` reads and merges local files by relative path, so only point it at config you
> trust — treat a base file the same as the config that includes it.

## What it manages

| Section | Manages |
| --- | --- |
| `settings` | description, homepage, topics, visibility, features (issues/wiki/projects/discussions), merge options (squash/merge/rebase, auto-merge, delete-branch-on-merge), default branch |
| `actions` | Actions enablement and allowed-actions policy (`enabled`, `allowed_actions`, `selected_actions` patterns), default workflow permissions (`default_workflow_permissions`), and workflow approval permission (`can_approve_pull_request_reviews`) |
| `rulesets` | repository rulesets (branch/tag): the full rule set (pull_request, required_status_checks, required_linear_history, non_fast_forward, deletion, creation, update, required_deployments, merge_queue, required_signatures, the *_pattern rules, file_path/extension/size restrictions, workflows, code_scanning), plus `bypass_actors` and ref-name `conditions` |
| `labels` | create/update/delete labels to match the listed set exactly |
| `collaborators` | add/re-permission direct collaborators; remove those not listed |
| `webhooks` | create/update/delete webhooks, matched by URL |
| `secrets` | Actions secrets (write-only; libsodium-encrypted by PyGithub); delete those not listed |
| `variables` | Actions repository variables (plain text; updated only when the value differs); delete those not listed |

### Design notes / limitations

- **A declared section is authoritative.** Each section you include is the *complete*
  desired set: items present on the repo but absent from the section are removed (labels,
  webhooks, secrets, variables deleted; direct collaborators removed; repo rulesets
  deleted). A section you omit is left entirely unmanaged. This means a declared section
  can revoke access or delete a secret by omission — declare deliberately.
- **Only directly-granted collaborator access is managed.** Pruning uses
  `affiliation="direct"`, so access inherited from org or team membership is never listed
  and never touched (the repo API can't revoke it anyway).
- **Rulesets are matched by name and updated to the full declared spec.** PyGithub has no
  ruleset support, so this is driven through its authenticated requester against the REST
  rulesets API. On update, a ruleset's rules/conditions/bypass actors are PUT to exactly
  what the config declares. A declared ruleset's *lists* (rules, bypass actors, ref-name
  patterns) must match the live ones exactly — a manually-added rule is drift that triggers
  an update — while server-supplied metadata the config never sets (item `integration_id`,
  bypass `actor_id`, timestamps) is ignored, so it can't cause churn. Listing passes
  `includes_parents=false`, so inherited org/enterprise rulesets are never matched or
  deleted through the repo.
- **Secrets and webhook secrets are write-only.** The API never returns a secret value, so
  a change to *only* a secret can't be diffed: an Actions secret already present on the repo
  is left untouched by default (pass `--force-secrets` to re-push values for rotation), and
  a webhook with a configured secret is always re-sent (shown as `(set)` in the plan).
  Values are sourced from the environment (`value_from_env` / `secret_from_env`) and never
  printed. A literal `value:` is supported for secrets but should never be committed.
- **Variables, by contrast, are readable.** An Actions *variable* value is returned by the
  API, so a variable is updated only when its value actually differs and the value is shown
  in plain text in the plan. Variables take a literal `value:` or `value_from_env:` (same
  shape as secrets, minus the secrecy).

## Fleet automation

Beyond the CLI, the [nivintw/repo-management repository][repo] — the tool's home — is
itself a working deployment: a control plane that manages its author's repositories (its
"fleet") with scheduled GitHub Actions, authenticating as a CI GitHub App. It doubles as a
reference for running the tool this way:

- **`apply-config` / `plan-config`** — reconcile the live repos to the repository's
  `config/*.yml`: `apply` on push to `main`, `plan` as a read-only PR preview.
- **`renovate`** — a central, self-hosted [Renovate] runner that opens dependency-update
  PRs across the managed fleet on a schedule, replacing the hosted Renovate app (and
  unlocking `postUpgradeTasks`, so a bumped binary's checksum is refreshed inside
  Renovate's own commit). It scopes its App token to exactly the fleet —
  `repo-management list-repos --format names` derives that set from the same `config/*.yml`
  that drives `apply`, so one config is the single source of truth for what Renovate
  touches. Its global behaviour lives in the repository's
  [`.github/renovate-global.json`][renovate-global], separate from the repository's own
  dependency policy in [`.github/renovate.json`][renovate-json]. Dispatch it manually with
  **`dryRun`** to preview the scope and proposed changes without opening any PRs.

## Development

Clone [the repository][repo], then:

```bash
uv sync                      # create the venv + install everything
uv run pytest                # tests + coverage (gate: 90%; currently 100%)
uvx prek run --all-files     # the full quality gate (ruff, format, REUSE, typos, …)
```

Quality checks run identically locally and in CI via prek hooks: git hygiene, gitleaks,
typos, rumdl, SPDX/REUSE headers, and ruff. Conventional Commits (gitmoji) are enforced at
commit-msg time. A few hooks shell out to **system tools** prek can't bootstrap — install
them locally too (most are in Homebrew): `hawkeye`, `taplo`, `osv-scanner`.
