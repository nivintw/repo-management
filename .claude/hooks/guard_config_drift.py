"""PreToolUse guard: warn on twin drift, and block language-agnostic config in pyproject.toml.

Two edit-time guards:

1. Twin-drift WARNING (own dogfood repo only). copier-everything keeps certain files as both a
   templated source under `template/` and a rendered copy at the repo root — "twins" that must
   stay in sync (tests/test_synced_files.py detects drift in CI; scripts/resync_twins.py fixes
   it). This warns, at edit time, when you touch one side, naming its partner — the preventive
   counterpart. It only fires when a `template/` dir exists, so a generated project (no template)
   never sees it.

2. Ban language-agnostic config in pyproject.toml (BLOCK, everywhere). Python is optional here,
   so `pyproject.toml` only exists for Python projects; config that isn't Python-specific must
   live in its language-neutral home under `.config/` instead. Writing one of those tables into
   pyproject.toml is blocked, pointing at the right file.

The WATCHED twin set and the banned-table list are derived from copier-everything's OWN layout
(tests/test_guard_config_drift.py verifies WATCHED against test_synced_files' buckets), not
copied from any downstream.
